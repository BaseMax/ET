# Mission Statement of The One Programming Language

- Explanation of requirements and situation of programmer with current interpreters and compilers
- And explain the project objectives and purposes

## A draft summary from whole of the project

What does this means? A tool to write command-line software.
> system-level, processing tool, doing calculate, for mathematics purpose, etc.
E.g: C, Go, Rust, C++

Similar to what we learned in university from Programming session.
> read input / do calculation / show output

And now, Why they should choose One and not C?
Because we are prepared so many required functionality and features. Somethings usually needed in most projects.

So developers can write/develop programs easily
And some features of this language cause to decrease bugs when developing a program.

This is first step of project.

==================

At the next step, we want to release a framework for web.
And purpose of this is to design/create websites without learn another tool and language.

In general, you need to learn at least 3-4 languages or more tools to create a website.
But we want to everyone can create a website without learning anythings more. by using only One language in same syntax.

## Some draft and messages between my recent inbox

This is just to get a basic idea of what you can say and how you think:

The ease of our language in the library will be determined at runtime, and this is not a matter of the first stage.

It's why a person does not use C and comes here to use One. because it's really nice with many needed features.

Some of the features we have can bring Python comfort to C.

-------

##### We want to help developers to write less bugs and more useful programs.

Did you say C? It does not have a package manager at all. A very necessary tool is the package manager. So that others can manage libraries more easily.
Of course, it should not be like npm chaotic.
The package manager designed in Python and Go is nice and clean.

Next we need to keep runtime library functions to work in Windows, Linux, macOS as well.

In the next step, it will be determined when you can design the site using the same language.
This is what I will design in the next step.

---------

Languages like Python and PHP are good.
But they are not compilers and have other problems.

We need to keep some features of script language in a compiler / system language.
I am not talking about static variables, What I mean is more than that. Usually in script interpreter languages we have many good features and functions.
But they are mostly lost in C.

Developers need to be able to create secure executable files / output from the program source.

For example: PHP is a good language, but it's not clear. Why not clean?

```php
unlink(): remove a file
fopen(): open a file to read/write/append
file_put_contents(): open a file to write/append
file_get_contents(): open a file to read
```

See function names, they are really bad. Why deleting a file is not related to other function names.

What we want to design is: `file.create() , file.delete(), file.copy()` and etc.

These examples do not end here and continue.
I hope I was able to convey my meaning to you.

This is what I wrote two years ago:

Maybe the reasons I mentioned are enough for a good language. But we do not want to produce a good product. We have to make something great.

I'm not going to make anything for myself. It's supposed to be something that helps others. So I should not be alone. Maybe you have ideas that we can take into and make a better product.
So your ideas are highly appreciated. I can say you have good experiences.

I end my message with a sentence from a businessman: Fall in love with your customers' problems. Do not love your product.
